# Multi-Class Deep Learning Experiment

## Experiment Overview

The experiment involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Shuffling of the data before training.
   - Division of the 'train.csv' data into appropriate percentages for training and validation sets.

2. **Model Design and Training**
   - Design and training of a neural network model (you can use a DNN network or other models of your choice).

3. **Model Tuning**
   - Utilization of the validation data for model tuning.
   - Monitoring the F1-score while applying early stopping logic from the Keras library.

4. **Evaluation on Test Data**
   - Calculation of appropriate classification metrics on the test data.

5. **Metrics Explanation**
   - Explanation of the significance of each metric, such as what recall denotes in terms of multi-class classification.

6. **Loss and F1-Score Curves**
   - Generation of loss and F1-score curves for both the training and validation sets.

7. **ROC-AUC Curve**
   - Generation of a ROC-AUC curve.
   - Comments on model accuracy and determination of the optimal threshold from the curve.

8. **Sampling**
   - Repeating the above steps with sampling in the training set.
   - Comparison and commentary on the results obtained from the sampled data and the original data distribution.
